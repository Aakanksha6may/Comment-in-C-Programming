# Comment-in-C-Programming

So, the very first question is why there is a need of comment in C Programming >

 Let's say there is a very big and complex C code and we view it after a long period of time, then when there will be comment, it will be easy for us to understand the code even after a long period of time.
  
  So, let's start to know how to do one line comment -
  
Inside the parenthesis {}, we will use 2 slant lines towards right 

#include<stdio.h>

void main()

{

//so, for single line comment inside the parenthesis we use two slant lines towrds right

printf("Aakanksha Kumari");

}

Above written codes are for single line comment. So, now let's know how to do multiple line comment :-

For multiple line comment we use a slash titled towards right / and after that use * in the beginning of the multiple line comment and at the end of the multi line comments use * and then slash titlted towards right/. The code for multiple line comment is :-

#include<stdio.h>

void main()

{

/* This is how we do multiple line comment
  this is one line
  this is another line
  and in this way we have written three four lines */
  
  printf("Multiline Comment");
  
  }
